# Weather-Dashboard

## Purpose

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. As practice to a real world scenario, the purpose is to practice accessing a third-party API's data to run a weather dashboard.

## Design

```
Build a weather dashboard by retrieving weather data for cities using [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

```
## Functionality

```

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
